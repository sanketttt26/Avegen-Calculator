- **Basic Calculator Functionality**: Perform arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Custom Keyboard**: A custom numeric keypad is provided for easy calculations.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Input Display**: The app dynamically adjusts the font size when the input exceeds the display width.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A framework for building native mobile apps using React.
- **Expo**: A set of tools for building React Native apps quickly and easily.
- **React Navigation**: For handling app navigation (if needed in the future).
- **Context API**: For managing theme (light/dark mode) across the app.
- **Custom Components**: Including a custom keyboard component (`MyKeyboard`) for user input.
